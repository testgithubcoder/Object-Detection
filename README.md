# Object-Detection
Object Detection using Webcam

Overview

This project implements real-time object detection using a webcam. It utilizes a deep learning model to detect and classify objects in the video feed.

Requirements

Python 3.x

OpenCV

TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on the model used)

NumPy

Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

Webcam (Required for real-time detection)

Installation

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Ensure your webcam is connected.

Run the object detection script:

python detect.py

The webcam feed will open, and detected objects will be displayed with bounding boxes and labels.

Model

The project uses a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN) for object detection.

The model can be customized or retrained for specific use cases.

Notes

Ensure the webcam is enabled and accessible.

Adjust confidence thresholds in the script for better detection accuracy.
